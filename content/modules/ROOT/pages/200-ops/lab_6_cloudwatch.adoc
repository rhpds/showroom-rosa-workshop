== Introduction

Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) clusters store log data inside the cluster by default. Understanding metrics and logs is critical in successfully running your cluster. Included with ROSA is the OpenShift Cluster Logging Operator, which is intended to simplify log management and analysis within a ROSA cluster, offering centralized log collection, powerful search capabilities, visualization tools, and integration with other monitoring systems like https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/[Amazon CloudWatch].

Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service provided by Amazon Web Services. It allows you to collect, store, analyze and visualize logs, metrics and events from various AWS resources and applications. Since ROSA is a first party AWS service, it integrates with Amazon CloudWatch and forwards its infrastructure, audit and application logs to Amazon CloudWatch.

In this section of the workshop, we'll configure ROSA to forward logs to Amazon CloudWatch.

== Prepare Amazon CloudWatch

. First, let's set some helper variables that we'll need throughout this section of the workshop. To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
export OIDC_ENDPOINT=$(oc get authentication.config.openshift.io \
  cluster -o json | jq -r .spec.serviceAccountIssuer | \
  sed  's|^https://||')

export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity \
  --query Account --output text)

echo OIDC_Endpoint: ${OIDC_ENDPOINT}, AWS Account ID: ${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
OIDC_Endpoint: rh-oidc.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/235ftpmaq3oavfin8mt600af4sar9oej, AWS Account ID: 264091519843
----

. Validate that a policy `RosaCloudWatch` already exists and if it does not create it:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
POLICY_ARN=$(aws iam list-policies --query "Policies[?PolicyName=='RosaCloudWatch'].{ARN:Arn}" --output text)

if [[ -z "${POLICY_ARN}" ]]; then
cat << EOF > ${HOME}/policy.json
{
"Version": "2012-10-17",
"Statement": [
   {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
            "logs:CreateLogGroup",
            "logs:CreateLogStream",
            "logs:DescribeLogGroups",
            "logs:DescribeLogStreams",
            "logs:PutLogEvents",
            "logs:PutRetentionPolicy"
         ],
         "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:*:*:*"
   }
]
}
EOF

POLICY_ARN=$(aws iam create-policy --policy-name "RosaCloudWatch" \
--policy-document file:///${HOME}/policy.json --query Policy.Arn --output text)
fi

echo ${POLICY_ARN}
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
arn:aws:iam::264091519843:policy/RosaCloudWatch
----

. Next, let's create a trust policy document which will define what service account can assume our role.
To create the trust policy document, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat <<EOF > ${HOME}/cloudwatch-trust-policy.json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
    "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}:oidc-provider/${OIDC_ENDPOINT}"
    },
    "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
    "Condition": {
      "StringEquals": {
        "${OIDC_ENDPOINT}:sub": "system:serviceaccount:openshift-logging:logcollector"
      }
    }
  }]
}
EOF
----

. Next, let's take the trust policy document and use it to create a role.
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
ROLE_ARN=$(aws iam create-role --role-name "RosaCloudWatch-${GUID}" \
--assume-role-policy-document file://${HOME}/cloudwatch-trust-policy.json \
--tags "Key=rosa-workshop,Value=true" \
--query Role.Arn --output text)

echo ${ROLE_ARN}
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
arn:aws:iam::264091519843:role/RosaCloudWatch-6n4s8
----

. Now, let's attach the pre-created `RosaCloudWatch` IAM policy to the newly created IAM role.
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
aws iam attach-role-policy \
  --role-name "RosaCloudWatch-${GUID}" \
  --policy-arn "${POLICY_ARN}"
----

== Configure Cluster Logging

The CLO (Cluster Logging Operator) provides a set of APIs to control collection and forwarding of logs from all pods and nodes in a cluster. This includes application logs (from regular pods), infrastructure logs (from system pods and node logs), and audit logs (special node logs with legal/security implications). In this section we will install cluster logging operator on the ROSA cluster and configure it to forward logs to Amazon CloudWatch.

. Now, we need to deploy the OpenShift Cluster Logging Operator. First we need to create an `OperatorGroup` for the operator:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
---
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: openshift-logging
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
  targetNamespaces:
  - openshift-logging
EOF
----

. Now we can create the Operator `Subscription`. To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
---
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  labels:
   operators.coreos.com/cluster-logging.openshift-logging: ""
  name: cluster-logging
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
  channel: stable
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
  name: cluster-logging
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
EOF
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
subscription.operators.coreos.com/cluster-logging created
----

. Now, we will wait for the OpenShift Cluster Logging Operator to install.
To do so, we can run the following command to watch the status of the installation:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc -n openshift-logging rollout status deployment \
  cluster-logging-operator
----
+
.After a minute or two, your output should look something like this:
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
deployment "cluster-logging-operator" successfully rolled out
----
+
[TIP]
====
If you get an error `Error from server (NotFound): deployments.apps "cluster-logging-operator" not found` wait a few seconds and try again.
====

. Next, we need to create a secret containing the ARN of the IAM role that we previously created above.
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloudwatch-credentials
  namespace: openshift-logging
stringData:
  role_arn: ${ROLE_ARN}
EOF
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
secret/cloudwatch-credentials created
----

. Next, let's configure the OpenShift Cluster Logging Operator by creating a Cluster Log Forwarding custom resource that will forward logs to Amazon CloudWatch.
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
---
apiVersion: logging.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterLogForwarder
metadata:
  name: instance
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
  outputs:
  - name: cw
    type: cloudwatch
    cloudwatch:
      groupBy: namespaceName
      groupPrefix: rosa-${GUID}
      region: $(aws configure get region)
    secret:
      name: cloudwatch-credentials
  pipelines:
  - name: to-cloudwatch
    inputRefs:
    - infrastructure
    - audit
    - application
    outputRefs:
    - cw
EOF
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
clusterlogforwarder.logging.openshift.io/instance created
----

. Next, let's create a Cluster Logging custom resource which will enable the OpenShift Cluster Logging Operator to start collecting logs.
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
---
apiVersion: logging.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterLogging
metadata:
  name: instance
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
  collection:
    logs:
      type: fluentd
  forwarder:
    fluentd: {}
  managementState: Managed
EOF
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
clusterlogging.logging.openshift.io/instance created
----

. After a few minutes, you should begin to see log groups inside of Amazon CloudWatch.
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
aws logs describe-log-groups \
  --log-group-name-prefix rosa-${GUID}
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,json,options=nowrap]
----
{
    "logGroups": [
        {
            "logGroupName": "rosa-fxxj9.audit",
            "creationTime": 1682098364311,
            "metricFilterCount": 0,
            "arn": "arn:aws:logs:us-east-2:511846242393:log-group:rosa-fxxj9.audit:*",
            "storedBytes": 0
        },
        {
            "logGroupName": "rosa-fxxj9.infrastructure",
            "creationTime": 1682098364399,
            "metricFilterCount": 0,
            "arn": "arn:aws:logs:us-east-2:511846242393:log-group:rosa-fxxj9.infrastructure:*",
            "storedBytes": 0
        }
    ]
}
----

Congratulations!

You've successfully forwarded your cluster's logs to the Amazon CloudWatch service.
